##  What is React Native ? 

Principle of the React team: 

> Learn once, write everywhere 

so we will be building native applications using javascript and react  , or in more accurate terms an extension of react - reactNative 

compiles to native code - not a webapp or hybrid app 

div > android.view > UIView > View 
input > EditText > UITextField > TextInput
